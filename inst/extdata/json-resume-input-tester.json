It included various protocols including Supervised Internet and SSL.We completed the task within a time frame that had never been done before, and we had to create the infrastructure to test the solution before final implementation. This team was a difficult assignment, and Charles was its most valuable member.He is very detail oriented, conscientious and a team player who is capable of coping well with frequent interruptions."
